future:
	add credits to readme
	consider using heroicons

	optimize by making it one single canvas instead of one per row, add option to copy/download img
option to fullscreen only the canvas and play
modal for learning about what is cellular automata etc
animate the rows (moving up)? settings for animations speed (pause/play, restart)
	settings for initial conditions/starting point? random option?
modal where you can view all 256 in a table in smaller view? print btn for modal?
