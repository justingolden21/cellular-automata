priority:
organize js
consider using heroicons

future:
use flex for multiple sections on larger screens?
binary input option? maybe in a modal. click the canvas to flip the bit? maybe a checkbox...

maybe:
store settings in url params (or cookies, or download txt file options), reset settings btn
replace some numeric inputs with sliders
raw data option for center column
add option to print img
more settings for initial conditions?
stroke color settings and other visual settings?
print button for canvas (with options?)
display a logic ciruit, using a k-map, for the cellular automata
make tests js script to run tests to ensure all relevant code works before push
save display settings to local storage, btn to clear/reset

css:
new lines for checboxes settings
add padding and hover bg color to details

bugs:
dark mode doesn't work in PWA offline
