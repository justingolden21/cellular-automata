future:
	organize js
	consider using heroicons
use flex for multiple sections on larger screens?
modal where you can view all 256 in a table in smaller view? print btn for modal?
binary input option? maybe in a modal. click the canvas to flip the bit? maybe a checkbox...

bonus points:
display a logic ciruit, using a k-map, for the cellular automata

maybe:
store settings in url params (or cookies, or download txt file options), reset settings btn
replace some numeric inputs with sliders
raw data option for center column
add option to print img
option to fullscreen only the canvas and play
more settings for initial conditions?
stroke color settings and other visual settings?
